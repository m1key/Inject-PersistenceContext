The goal of this project is to test Arquillian's ability to @Inject
@PersistenceContext annotated fields.

There are two unit tests that use an in-memory database instance (powered by
HSQLDB):
	* JpaDogRepositoryExplicitSetTest
	* JpaDogRepositoryInjectPcTest

The first one explicitly sets the @PersistenceContext annotated entity manager
and all tests should pass. This is not what I want though. I want Arquillian to
CDI @Inject the persistence context. That's what the other test is testing and
for now it's failing with a NullPointerException.
