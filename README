The goal of this project is to test Arquillian's ability to @Inject
@PersistenceContext annotated fields.

There are two unit tests that use an in-memory database instance (powered by
HSQLDB):
	* JpaDogRepositoryExplicitSetTest
	* JpaDogRepositoryInjectPcTest

The first one explicitly sets the @PersistenceContext annotated entity manager
and all tests should pass. This is not what I want though. I want Arquillian to
CDI @Inject the persistence context. That's what the other test is testing.

It now works as long as Arquillian has been build with my change and provided
that the Hibernate version used includes the fix for HHH-6442.
